Brainstorming for project idea: 
- comparing urban vs. rural malnutrition
- comparing demand in urban vs. rural
- we can get rural vs. urban dummy (LIGON)
- to isolate effects with younger population, can isolate a specific variable where you have (# of people 0-8)/(total # of people in household), and use this as a way of calibrating the demand characteristics. 

- there's also climate shocks that might be contributing to these levels of malnutrition?
    - doing a food insecurity vs. climate shock
- in Guatemala: the "dry corridor," where it's the dryest, and there's extreme drought
