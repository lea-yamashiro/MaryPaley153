Brainstorming for project idea: 
- comparing urban vs. rural malnutrition
- comparing demand in urban vs. rural
- we can get rural vs. urban dummy
- to isolate effects with younger population, can isolate a specific variable where you have (# of people 0-8)/(total # of people in household), and use this as a way of calibrating the demand characteristics.
