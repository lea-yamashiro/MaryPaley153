# Project 3: Food Demand

## Motivation & Overview 

This project is about individual people's **CHOICES**, in particular: 
- what food to eat
- how *much* food to eat

Choices always vary, as humans often behave stochastically, and generally are influenced by infinite factors. Sometimes choices can lead to inexpensive, nutritious diets, but not always. 

In examining demand, we focus on the relationship between **diet, budget,** and **prices**. The overall goal of the project is to be able to give a clear characterization of this relationship for some particular real-world population of interest.

Further notes: 
It's a difficult project, a real economist's problem. We don't have utility functions for every food we can think of. 
So, we're trying to do an optimization – to produce a description of the utility that people derive from food, and THEN: get demand functions that we can recreate out of utility functions, once we have them. 
We want to think about supply, demand, (focus here is on demand), and a *little* bit of welfare. 

## Data Requirements

One of the biggest challenges of this project is finding adequate data. Conceptually, the data we'll work with includes: 
- detailed data on food consumption (or expenditures)
- data on household or individual characteristics that may influence demand, e.g: 
    - household size
    - population composition
- Food conversion table, which allows us to map quantities of food into nutritional outcomes

## Deliverables 

### A Deliverables

**[A.1] Choice of population with associated expenditure data** 
- Probably most important decision we make
- Lots of different populations that are interesting, but only a few populations have data that can support a careful demand analysis.
- Ligon will provide some "curated" datasets that we can use, but we're welcome to find our own

**[A.2] Estimate Demand System**
- Estimate a system of demands for different kinds of food
- Characterize how consumption varies with household need

### B Deliverables

**[B.1] Nutritional content of different foods** 
For all foods we're considering, need to: 
- describe their nutritional content of food
- describe nutritional in terms that allow us to compare with recommended daily allowances
- Note: they'll provide pointers to US Govt. recommendations, but many countries have their own recommendations, which might be better suited to their populations.

**[B.2] Nutritional adequacy of diet** 
Given the food actually consumed in the data, 
- what can you say about the adequacy of the diets in the population of interest?
- what proportion of households consume enough so that members will exceed or meet dietary recommendations?
- what proportion do not meet these recommendations?

### C Deliverables

**[C.1] Counterfactual Experiments**
If everyone's total food expenditures doubled (holding prices fixed): 
- how would this affect nutrition in the population?
- what if relative food prices changed?
- think of other counterfactual experiments that might be interesting.
